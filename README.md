## Introduction
For a while I was searching for a tool that would enable me to use a Cloudflare R2 bucket with pre-signed URLs for public file hosting with a decent amount of caching put in place to avoid overcharging... Well, I found nothing that suited my needs and made this thing...

## Getting started
You can deploy this thing on Docker or standalone, nobody is there to stop you... However, some environment variables will have to be set up (either on a .env file or inside the docker-compose file)!

| Variable             | Value                                             | Default                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| REDIS                | Your redis instance connection URI                | redis://127.0.0.1:6379 |
| S3_ENDPOINT          | https://\<accountid\>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com    | none (required)        |
| S3_ACCESS_KEY        | Cloudflare R2 Access key                          | none (required)        |
| S3_SECRET_KEY        | Cloudflare R2 Secret key                          | none (required)        |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN      | Public access custom domain (for pre-signed URLs) | none (required)        |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_PASSWORD | The password for any archives (public)            | none                   |

## Why is there no state management
I could've used tools like `useContext()` or even better [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) but this project is too simple to overcomplicate with that kind of utilities. In addition, some prop drilling that needed to be done enables server-side pre-rendering to happen more flawlessly resulting in partial support for Internet Explorer or even disabling JavaScript... Yes!

## License
**Take the code and do whatever you want with it.** I don't care about this specific project enough to actually put a license on it. It's more of a simple production application to both suit my exact needs and serve as "showoff" to future employers.
